# atlas-model
The Python script ATLAS_model.py allows to replicate the modelling analysis proposed in the manuscript 'More than one million barriers fragment Europeâ€™s rivers' by Belletti et al.

Other procedures and GIS steps (as described in Methods) were conducted manually and are therefore not part of the code repository.
